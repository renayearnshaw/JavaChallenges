# JavaChallenges
A selection of challenges in Java that might get thrown at you during interviews.
1. **FizzBuzz**\
  Write a short program that prints each number from 0 to *n* on a new line.
    * For each multiple of 3, print "Fizz" instead of the number.
    * For each multiple of 5, print "Buzz" instead of the number.
    * For each number that is a multiple of both 3 and 5, print "FizzBuzz" instead of the number.
    
    Use as few characters as possible
2. **TwoSum**\
  Given an array of integers, return indices of the two numbers that add up to a specific target.
  You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution, and you may not use the same element twice.
  
   **Example:**\
   Given `nums = [2, 7, 11, 15], target = 9`,\
   Because `nums[0] + nums[1] = 9, return [0, 1]`
3. **ReverseString**\
  Write a short program that reverses a string. This is done in three ways:
    * Using low-level string manipulation.
    * Using low-level string iteration, but building the new string with `StringBuilder`.
    * Using the `StringBuilder` API. This is what you'd do in the real world.
4. **Stack**\
  Write a class to implement a stack (LIFO). Provide the following API's:
    * `push(item)` to push an item onto the stack.
    * `pop()` to pop an item off the stack (the last item pushed).
    * `peek()` to look at the item on the top of the stack.
5. **ReverseInteger**\
  Write a short program that reverses an integer.
    * Handle negative numbers.
    * Handle maximum and minimum integer values.
5. **IntegerToRomanNumeral**\
  Write a short program that converts an integer to a roman numeral.
  The value of the integer is limited to between one and three thousand.
