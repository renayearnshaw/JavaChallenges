# JavaChallenges
A selection of challenges in Java that might get thrown at you during interviews.
1. **FizzBuzz**\
  Write a short program that prints each number from 0 to *n* on a new line.
    * For each multiple of 3, print "Fizz" instead of the number.
    * For each multiple of 5, print "Buzz" instead of the number.
    * For each number that is a multiple of both 3 and 5, print "FizzBuzz" instead of the number.
    
    Use as few characters as possible
2. **TwoSum**\
  Given an array of integers, return indices of the two numbers that add up to a specific target.
  You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution, and you may not use the same element twice.
  
   **Example:**\
   Given <code>nums = [2, 7, 11, 15], target = 9</code>,\
   Because <code>nums[0] + nums[1] = 9, return [0, 1]</code>
